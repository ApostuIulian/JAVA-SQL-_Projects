# PolynomialCalculator

1)Project Description

  This project implements a polynomial calculator with 6 mathematical operations:
-addition
-substraction
-multiplication
-division
-derivative
-integration

  These operations can be selected by the user and applied on the desired polynomials
with the help of the dedicated graphical interface.

2)How to use

  Insert the desired polynomials in the fields mentioning the coefficient and the exponent 
for every monomial even for values like 1 and 0. Choose an operation and the result will be
shown in the first uneditable field (1.for the derivative and integration, the operation will
take the first polynomial from the first field | 2.if the result is 0, the result field will be empty).

# QueueManagement

1)Project Description
  This project implements a real time queue management system based on the input given by the user.
  
2)How to use
  Insert the desired simulation time, number of queues, number of clients, arival time interval and
the service time inteval. After all the fields were filled, press the 'Start Simulation' button.
A new frame will pop up where you can visualize the evolution of all queues in real time and the clients
left to serve. At the end of the simulation (the simulation ends when the time is up or there are no more
clients to be served) the average waiting time, average service time and the peak hour will be displayed
in the bottom right corner.
