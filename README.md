# PolynomialCalculatorJAVA

1)Project Description

  This project represents a polynomial calculator with 6 mathematical operations:
-addition
-substraction
-multiplication
-division
-derivative
-integration

  These operations can be selected by the user and applied on the desired polynomials
with the help of the dedicated graphical interface.

2)How to use

  Insert the desired polynomials in the fields mentioning the coefficient and the exponent 
for every monomial even for values like 1 and 0. Choose an operation and the result will be
shown in the first uneditable field (for the derivative and integration, the operation will
take the first polynomial from the first field).
